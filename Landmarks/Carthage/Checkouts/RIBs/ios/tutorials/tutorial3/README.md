# RIBs Tutorial 3: RIB Dependency Injection and Communication


This project is the starting point for [tutorial 3](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-3).

### Getting started
Install tooling, unless you've done so already:

```
<RIBs path>/ios/tooling/install-xcode-template.sh
```

Then, install pods for the tutorial:

```
gem install cocoapods # In case you don't have it
cd <RIBs path>/ios/tutorials/tutorial3
pod install
```

Then, open the TicTacToe.xcworkspace that was generated by `pod install` and follow the steps described in [tutorial 3](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-3) on the RIBs wiki.
